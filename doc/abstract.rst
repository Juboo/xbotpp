Protocol abstraction layer
==========================

These classes are designed to store all the necessary data about anything the
bot may interact with, whether that be a user, a channel, or something else.

The bot protocol libraries are expected to construct instances of these classes
and use those when interacting with the bot, instead of letting the underlying
protocol shine through.
