Event handlers
==============

.. automodule:: xbotpp.handler.handlers
   :members:

   .. data:: dispatch

      Dictionary of events that can be thrown. 

      Each dictionary entry is of the format ``'event_name': [<function>, ...]``
      where the functions are the event handler callbacks for that event.
